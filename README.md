## Description


- The Module 2 challenge was to test are knowledge on css and all it's fun!
- This project instructed to build a professional portfolio to showcase current and future projects to employers.
- creating this portfolio solves the problem of having to scout different locations to showoff your work. with this portfolio you're able to show everything on one webpage. 
- I learned a ton during this challenge. The most memorable was the css variables like flex hover, media query and much more.
